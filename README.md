# Clustering Analysis

This project analyzes clustering performance on the Iris dataset using different preprocessing techniques and clustering algorithms.

## Methodology

1. **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is used, which consists of four features representing flower characteristics.  
2. **Preprocessing Methods**: Various preprocessing techniques are applied, including standardization, normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), and transformations.  
3. **Clustering Algorithms**: The analysis compares K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Mean-Shift clustering.  
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Clustering performance is assessed using the Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.  
5. **Results Storage**: The computed metrics for each clustering configuration are saved in a CSV file and formatted into a LaTeX table.

## Output

- A CSV file containing clustering performance results.  
- A LaTeX-formatted table summarizing the evaluation metrics.  

This project helps compare the impact of preprocessing techniques on different clustering algorithms.
